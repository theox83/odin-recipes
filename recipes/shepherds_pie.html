    <h2>what is Shepherd’s Pie</h2>
    <p>Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or in its French version hachis Parmentier is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked. The meat used may be either previously cooked</p><p> or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb. The two English terms have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and the 19th century, although some writers insist </p><p>that a shepherd's pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef.</p>

    <p>I called this recipe Shepherd’s Pie.  But, I wrote the recipe so that
         you could use ground beef or ground lamb.</p> <b></b>
